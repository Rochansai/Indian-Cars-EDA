# indian-cars-EDA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Indian car market. The goal is to uncover insights, trends, and patterns within the dataset, providing a deeper understanding of the factors that influence car prices, popularity, and other key metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:
- **Car Name**: The name or model of the car.
- **Manufacturer**: The company that manufactures the car.
- **Price**: The price of the car.
- **Engine Size**: The engine displacement in cubic centimeters (cc).
- **Mileage**: Fuel efficiency (e.g., kmpl).
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, etc.).
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission (Manual, Automatic).
- **Year**: The year of manufacture.
- **Other Features**: Additional features such as horsepower, torque, seating capacity, etc.

## Project Objectives
- **Analyze Price Distribution**: Understand the pricing trends across different car segments.
- **Explore Engine Size and Mileage**: Examine the relationship between engine size, mileage, and pricing.
- **Manufacturer Analysis**: Identify which manufacturers dominate the Indian car market and their pricing strategies.
- **Fuel Type and Transmission**: Investigate how fuel type and transmission type influence car prices and popularity.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze how car features and prices have evolved over time.

## Key Visualizations
- **Price Distribution**: Histograms or box plots to show price ranges.
- **Scatter Plots**: To explore the relationship between engine size, mileage, and price.
- **Bar Charts**: To compare manufacturers based on the number of models and average price.
- **Heatmaps**: To visualize correlations between different features.
- **Time Series Charts**: To track changes in car features and prices over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Pandas**: For handling and manipulating the dataset.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.


## Insights & Findings
- Summarize key insights gained from the analysis, such as which car features most influence pricing, the most popular car manufacturers, etc.

## Conclusion
This EDA provides a comprehensive overview of the Indian car market, highlighting key factors that influence car prices and popularity. The findings can help manufacturers, marketers, and consumers make informed decisions.
